# Data Analysis:

Data Analysis is the process of collecting, cleaning, organizing, 
and examining data to find useful information, identify patterns, 
and support decision-making.

1) To know what happend in the past(sales,..ect.)
2) why these things are happened
3) what to do next 
4) what are the things needed to be improved

# Types Of Data Analysis:

1) Descriptive Analysis:

** What happened? **

- Summarizes past data using charts, graphs, reports, and dashboards.

Example: Monthly sales report showing total revenue.


2) Diagnostic Analysis:

** Why did it happen? **

- Looks deeper into data to find reasons for outcomes.

Example: Analyzing why sales dropped (e.g., fewer customers or higher prices).


3) Predictive Analysis:

** What is likely to happen? **

- Uses historical data + machine learning/statistics to forecast future outcomes.

Example: Predicting future product demand based on past sales trends.


4) Prescriptive Analysis:

** What should we do? **

- Suggests actions/decisions to achieve desired results.

Example: Recommending marketing strategies to boost sales.


# Why Do we need Data Analysis:

We need Data Analysis to turn data into actionable knowledge 
that drives smarter, faster, and more effective decisions.

● Improves Decision-Making – Helps organizations and individuals take 
evidence-based decisions instead of guesses..

● Detects Trends & Patterns – Finds patterns in large datasets that may 
not be obvious.

● Optimizes Performance – Identifies errors, inefficiencies and areas of improvement.

● Enhances Customer Experience – Personalizes services based on data insights.

● Reduces Costs – Helps in budget planning and waste reduction.

● Risk Management → Helps detect fraud, manage financial risks, and ensure security.

● Forecasting → Predicts future outcomes (sales, demand, risks).


# Numpy:

List is not recommended - when evere we have a huge set of data as it takes 
lots of time to perform any kind of operations.

we use modules (numpy,pandas..)

1) Numpy (Numerical Python):

NumPy is a Python library that makes working with 
large arrays and mathematical operations fast and easy.

- NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful Python library for numerical computing. 

- widely used for multi-dimensional arrays, mathematical operations, and linear algebra
operations, making it essential for data analysis, machine learning, and scientific
computing.
